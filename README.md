# ComicCoverDetect

This program utilizes SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Descriptor) and the BoW method (Bag of Words) to detect if a comic book is Batman, Spiderman, or neither.

To run this program:
  1. opencv must along with its packages must be installed
  2. in command line, "python3 siftbow.py 1"
  
 Having "1" as an argument will only test comic book covers cropped, with no background. Any other argument will text comic book covers lying around in different backgrounds.
 
 
 Here are what the results should look like:
